\section{True or False}
\label{sec:true_or_false}

We first want to examine some thought experiments. Examine each one and figure
out what the statement means, and whether it is true or false.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The points $(-1, 1), (2, -1)$ and $(3, 0)$ lie on a line.

    We know from linear algebra, that if these points are to lie on the
    same line, they all have to satisfy the same linear equation $ax + b$.
    These do not, so the statement is false.

  \item If $x$ is an integer, then $x^2 \geq x$.

    This is an implication, on the form "if $A$, then $B$". We are
    interested in the world where $x$ is an integer, and want to examine
    whether this means that $x^2 \geq x$ must hold. We have three cases, $x
    > 0, x = 0$ and $x < 0$.  It holds for each case, so the statement is
    true. To prove this rigorously, we should use axiomatic set theory and
    the trichotomy of the integers.

  \item If $x$ is an integer, then $x ^ 3 \geq x$.

    This is a statement on the same form as above. This one however, is
    false, and we can show this just by finding a counter-example. We know
    that any negative number raised to an odd power is also negative.
    Hence, if we let $x < 0$ and $|x| > 1$ we must have that $x ^ 3 < x$.
    Thus, the statement is false.  

  \item For all real numbers $x$, $x^3 = x$.

    This again, is an implication, if one restates the statement.  If $x$
    is a real number, then $x ^ 3 = x$. Knowing that all integers are real
    numbers we can use the knowledge from the previous one to instantly see
    that this must be false. Just pick any real number other than $0$ and
    $1$ really.

  \item There exists a real number $x$ such that $x ^ 3 = x$.

    This statement is in some sense a weaker version of the statement
    above. It only asserts the existence of at least one. Hence, all we
    have to do is find a real number that satisfies the equation. If we let
    $x = 1$, then we have $1 ^ 3 = 1$, hence the statement is true.

  \item $\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number.

    To show this statement, we must remind ourselves what an irrational
    number is.  An irrational number is a number on the form $a / b$ where
    $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $b \neq 0$.  The statements essentially
    asserts that there are no numbers on the form $x = a / b$ such that $x
    ^ 2 = 2$.  We can assume for contradiction that there does exist some
    rational number $x$ such that $x ^ 2 = 2$. We can then write $x =
    \frac{a}{b}$, and we can also assume that the numbers are in their
    lowest terms. That any common factors have been canceled out.  If we
    square $x$, we get $x ^ 2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}$. Remember, that we assumed
    that the square of $x$ was equal to $2$, so we have that $2 =
    \frac{a^2}{b^2}$. Multiplying through by $b^2$ we get that $2b^2 =
    a^2$, hence $a^2$ must be an even number. But, in that case $a$ must be
    an even number, since the square of an even number is
    even.\footnote{This is shown in no. 8.} Thus, we can write $a$ on the
    form $2n$ for some integer $n$. If we substitute this into our previous
    equation we get that $2b^2 = 4n^2$, and the $2$'s cancel and we get
    $b^2 = 2n^2$, hence $b$ must be an even number. But this means that
    both $b$ and $a$ have the common factor of $2$, and since we assumed
    that $a$ and $b$ had no common factors this is the contradiction we
    wanted. Hence, $\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number.

  \item If $x + y$ is odd and $y + z$ is odd, then $x + z$ is odd.

    A number is odd if there exists some integer $n$ such that the number
    can be written on the form $2n + 1$. We therefore let $n, m \in
    \mathbb{Z}$ such that $x + y = 2n + 1$ and $y + z = 2m + 1$. Solving
    these equations for $x$ and $z$ respectively, we get that $x = 2n + 1 -
    y$ and $z = 2m + 1 - y$. Adding we see that $x + z = 2(n + m + 1 - y)$.
    Hence $x + z$ is an \textit{even} number, not an odd one.

  \item If $x$ is an even integer, then $x^2$ is an even integer. 

    Since $x$ is an even integer, we can write it on the form $x = 2n$ for
    some integer $n$. If we square $x$, we see that $x^2 = 4n^2$, which we
    can rewrite as $2(2n^2)$. Hence $x^2$ is an even integer. This fact was
    used in the proof for the irrationality of the square root of two
    above.

  \item Every positive integer is the sum of distinct powers of two.

    This one is tricky to solve, and I have no idea whether it is true or
    not.  By testing some cases one can easily see that most numbers follow
    this, and I have not found any counter-example.

  \item Every positive integer is the sum of distinct powers of three.

    Same as above, no idea.

  \item If $x$ is an integer, then $x$ is even or $x$ is odd.

    An even number is on the form $2n$ for some integer $n$, and hence,
    must be an integer.  The same goes for odd numbers on the form $2n +
    1$. Hence, if $x$ is even it must be an integer, and if $x$ is odd it
    must be an integer.  It now remains to show that if $x$ is an integer,
    then it cannot be neither even nor odd. If we assume that $x$ is an
    integer, but is neither even nor odd there must in some sense be a
    decimal part to $x$. And in that case it cannot be an integer.

  \item If $x$ is an integer, then $x$ cannot be both even and odd.

    If we assume $x$ to be an integer that can be written on the form $x =
    2n$ and $x = 2m + 1$ for some integers $n, m \in \mathbb{Z}$, then we
    can add the two expressions together to achieve
    \begin{equation}
      \notag
      2x = 2n + 2m + 1 = 2(n + m) + 1.
    \end{equation}
    If we solve this for $x$, we get that $x = 2(n+m) + \frac{1}{2}$. Hence
    $x$ is not an integer, which contradicts our initial assumption.  This
    concludes the proof.

  \item Every even integer greater than $2$ can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

    This is one of the unsolved problems in mathematics. I do not know how
    to solve this one, but later in this chapter I will attempt to rewrite
    the statement into equivalent ones to get different perspectives on the
    problem.

  \item There are infinitely many prime numbers.

    A prime number is a whole number that is only divisible by $1$ and
    itself. If we assume that there are a finite number of prime numbers
    $p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_n$ then we know that these have no common factors.
    We can now construct a new prime number, called $q$ like this:
    \begin{equation}
      \notag
      q = p_0\cdot p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n + 1
    \end{equation}

    This new number $q$ cannot possibly have any common factors with the
    other prime numbers, hence it is divisible only by itself and one.  We
    can repeat this process indefinitely to generate an infinite amount of
    prime numbers. Hence the statement is true.

  \item For any positive real number $x$ there exists a positive real number $y$ such that $y^2 = x$.

    This statement essentially asserts that given any real number $x$, we
    can always find another real number $y$ such that if you square this
    number $y$ you get $x$. Not quite sure how to prove this.

  \item Given three distinct points in space, there is one and only one plane passing through them.

    A plane is uniquely defined by three points in space only if they do not
    lie on the same line in space. Hence this statement is false, consider for
    instance three points lying on the $x$-axis.

\end{enumerate} 

I am now to divide my answers into four categories, namely the following:
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
  \item I am confident that the justification I gave is conclusive.

    1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14
  \item I am not confident that the justification I gave is conclusive.

    2
  \item I am confident that the justification I gave is \textit{not} conclusive. (If you gave no justification at all, your answer falls
    into this category.)

    9, 11, 13, 15, 16 
  \item I could not decide whether the statement was true or false.

    None
\end{enumerate}

\section{Statements and Predicates}
\label{sec:statements_and_predicates}

A \textbf{statement}\index{statement} is a sentence that is either true or false, but not ambiguous.


\begin{exrc}
  Give some examples of sentences that are statements and some examples of sentences that are not statements.
\end{exrc}

\begin{sltn}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{World War 2 ended in 1945} is a statement.
  \item \textit{The university campus was tranquil during the summer} is not a statement. What university are we talking about?
  \item \textit{The Eiffel tower is made of metal} is a statement.
  \item \textit{The building is made of bricks} is not a statement. Which building?
\end{enumerate}
\end{sltn}

A sentence with one or more free variables in it that becomes a statement
when the free variables takes on a particular value is called a
\textbf{predicate}\index{predicate}.

\begin{exrc}
  Give examples of mathematical predicates that have two and three free variables.
\end{exrc}

\begin{sltn}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{He ate bacon and eggs for breakfast} is a predicate with one free variable, "He".
  \item \textit{He said to her that he was leaving} is a predicate with two free variables, "He" and "She".
  \item $x ^ 2 + 3y = 12z$ is a predicate with three free variables, namely $x, y$ and $z$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{sltn}

\section{Quantification}

We can turn a predicate into a statement by substituting particular values
for its free variables. There are at least two other ways in  which
predicates can be used to build statements. We make a claim about which
values of the free variable turn the predicate into a true statement.

The phrases \textbf{for all}\index{for all} and \textbf{there
exists}\index{there exists} are called
\textbf{quantifiers}\index{quantifiers}, and the process of using
quantifiers to make statements out of predicates is called
\textbf{quantification}\index{quantification}.


\begin{exrc}
  Suppose we understand the free variable $z$ to refer to fish.
\end{exrc}

\begin{sltn}
If we let $A(z)$ stand for the predicate \textit{$z$ lives in the sea},
then the statement "for all $z$, $A(z)$" is true.

If we let $B(z)$ stand for the predicate \textit{$z$ is blue}, then the statement
"for all $z, B(z)$" is false but "there exists $z$ such that $B(z)$" is true.
\end{sltn}

"For all" is called the \textbf{universal quantifier}\index{universal
quantifier} and has the symbol $\forall$\index{$\forall$}.  "There exists \ldots such that"
is called the \textbf{existential quantifier}\index{existential quantifier}
and has the symbol $\exists$.\index{$\exists$}

You might find it curious that a sentence can contain a variable, as quantified
statements do, and yet be a statement. We call the variables in a statement
with quantifiers \textbf{bound variables}\index{bound variables}. This
essentially means that when the variable is bound there is no ambiguity.
Note that the order of quantification matters greatly.

\begin{exrc}
  Consider the following two statements.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item There exists $x$ and there exists $y$ such that $y^2 = x$.
    \item There exists $y$ and there exists $x$ such that $y^2 = x$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Did quantifying over $y$ and then $x$ rather than the other way around change
  the meaning of the statement? What if the quantifiers had been \textit{for
  all} instead of \textit{there exists}?
\end{exrc}

\begin{sltn}
It seems like the order of quantifiers do not matter as long as the
quantifiers are the same. In other words, having two "for all" quantifiers it
does not matter what order and similarly for two "there exists" quantifiers.
However, if we have one "for all" and one "there exists" changing the order
definitely changes the meaning of the statement. Examine the statements
\begin{enumerate}
  \item There exists $x$ such that for all $y$, $y^2 = x$.
  \item For all $x$ there exists $y$ such that $y^2 = x$.
\end{enumerate}
The first one asserts the existence of one single $x$ such that the equation
holds for all $y$, which is obviously false. The second one however asserts the
fact that no matter what number $x$ you pick you can always find a number $y$
that has $x$ as its square.
\end{sltn}

\begin{exrc}
  Consider the predicate about integers "$x = 2y$". There are six distinct ways
  of quantifying this statement. Find all six and determine the truth value.
\end{exrc}

\begin{sltn}
From the previous exercise, we can change the order of quantifiers without
altering the meaning of the statement. Thus, we have six distinct ways of
quantifying the statements.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\forall x \exists y$ such that $x = 2y$. Chose $x = 1$, this is false.
  \item $\exists x \forall y$ such that $x = 2y$. False.
  \item $\exists x \exists y$ such that $x = 2y$. True, $x = 2$ and $y = 1$.
  \item $\forall x \forall y$ such that $x = 2y$. False.
  \item $\forall y \exists x$ such that $x = 2y$. True.
  \item $\exists y \forall x$ such that $x = 2y$. False.
\end{enumerate}
\end{sltn}

\section{Mathematical Statements}
\label{sec:mathematical_statements}

The vast majority of mathematical statements can be written in the form "If
$A$, then $B$" where $A$ and $B$ are predicates. The question now is, if $A$
and $B$ are predicates then surely "If $A$, then $B$" should be a predicate as
well, not a statement. However, it is standard practice to assume universal
quantification over the variables. In other words, the statement is to be read
as "For all $x$, if $A(x)$, then $B(x)$".

\begin{defn}
  A statement on the form "If $A$, then $B$", where $A$ and $B$ are statements
  or predicates is called an \textbf{implication}\index{implication}. $A$ is
  called the \textbf{hypothesis}\index{hypothesis} of the statement and $B$ is
  called the \textbf{conclusion}\index{conclusion}.
\end{defn}

\addtocounter{thm}{1}

\begin{exrc}
  Identify the hypotheses and conclusions in each of the implications given in
  the previous example. (pg. 14)
\end{exrc}

\begin{sltn}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Hypothesis: $x + y$ is odd and $y + z$
        Conclusion: $x + z$ is odd
  \item Hypothesis: $x$ is an integer
        Conclusion: $x$ either even or odd, but not both
  \item Hypothesis: $x^2 < 17$
        Conclusion: $x$ is a positive real number.
  \item Hypothesis: $x$ is an integer
        Conclusion: $x^2 \geq 2$
  \item Hypothesis: $f$ is a polynomial of odd degree
        Conclusion: $f$ has at least one real root
\end{enumerate}
\end{sltn}

Remember that most mathematical statements can be rephrased as implications!

\section{Mathematical Implication}
\label{sec:mathematical_implication}

We first start by talking about what it means for an implication to be true.
\begin{exmp}
  If $x$ is an integer, then $x^2 \geq 2$.  
\end{exmp}
\begin{proof}
  If $x = 0$, then $x^2 = x$, so certainly $x^2 \geq x$. The same is true if $x
  = 1$. If $x \geq 1$, then $x^2 > 1 \cdot x = x$ If $x < 0$ then $x^2 > 0 >
  x$. This accounts for all integer values of $x$.
\end{proof}

Here we studied all the values of the variable $x$ that mate the hypothesis
true. We then showed that in those cases the conclusion also is true. We did
not care for the values of $x$ that were not integers because they are not relevant for our case.

\begin{exrc}
  We now consider the statement "If $x$ is an integer, then $x^3 \geq x$."
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that "If $x$ is an integer, then $x^3 \geq x$" is false.  \item
      Thinking in terms of hypotheses and conclusions, explain what you did to
      show that the statement is false.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exrc}

\begin{sltn}
To show that this statement is false, we simply have to find one
counter-example where we have an integer, but its cube is less than itself.  If
we for example let $x = -2$ we have that $x^3 = -8$ hence the statement is
clearly false.

In terms of hypotheses and conclusions, we only considered the values for $x$
that make the hypothesis true. Namely the integers. Then proceeded to find a
value for $x$ that satisfied the hypothesis yet did not satisfy the conclusion.
Hence a contradiction was found and the statement was proved to be false.
\end{sltn}

A value of $x$ that makes the hypothesis $A$ true and the conclusion $B$ false
is called a \textbf{counterexample}\index{counterexample}.

\begin{exrc}
  Occasionally you will see "If $A$, then $B$" written as "$A$ is sufficient
  for $B$" or "$B$ is necessary for $A$"or "$B$, if $A$" or "$A$ only if $B$".
  Explain why it is sensible to say that each of these means the same thing.
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
"$A$ is sufficient for $B$" means that if we have that $A$ is true, then $B$
also must be true because that $A$ is true is sufficient. This is equivalent to
the implication. "$B$ is necessary for $A$" means that if we have $A$ then we
also must have $B$. They essentially all mean the same thing.\footnote{I have
no idea how to properly explain this}
\end{sltn}

An implication in which the hypothesis is false is often said to be
\textbf{vacously true}\index{vacuously true}. We define the implication to be
true when the hypothesis is false because values that make the hypothesis false
can never generate a counterexample.

\section{Compound Statements and Truth Tables}
\label{sec:compund_statements_and_truth_tables}

Symbolically we write "If $A$, then $B$" as $A \impl B$\index{$\impl$}, which is
read "\textbf{A implies B}". 

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \caption{Truth table for implication}
  \label{tab:implication}
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    \hline
    A & B & A $\impl$ B \\
    \hline
    T & T & T \\
    T & F & F \\
    F & T & T \\
    F & F & T \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The above table is an example of a \textbf{truth table}\index{truth table}.
In addition to implication we can combine statements $A$ and $B$ in a number of ways.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item "A and B" is called the \textbf{conjunction}\index{conjunction}\index{$\land$} of A and B. This is denoted $A \land B$.
  \item "A or B" is called the \textbf{disjunction}\index{disjunction}\index{$\lor$} of A and B. We denote it by $A \lor B$.
  \item "Not A" is called the \textbf{negation}\index{negation}\index{$\neg$} of A. We denote it $\neg A$.
  \item "A if and only if B" is called the
    \textbf{equivalence}\index{equivalence}\index{$\eqvl$} of A and B. We
    denote it by $A \eqvl B$. ("If and only if" is often abbreviated
    \textbf{iff}\index{iff}.)
\end{enumerate}

\begin{defn}
  Suppose that A and B are statements. The following truth table gives the
  truth values of all the previously mentioned compound statements.
  \begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \caption{Compound statements}
    \label{tab:comp_statements}
    \begin{tabular}{ccccccc}
    \hline 
    {} & {} & A implies B & A and B & A or B & not A & A iff B \\
     A & B & $A \impl B$ & $A \land B$ & $A \lor B$ & $\neg A$ & $A \eqvl B$ \\
     T& T& T& T& T& F& T \\
     T& F& F& F& T& F& F \\
     F& T& T& F& T& T& F \\
     F& F& T& F& T& T& T \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{table}
\end{defn}

\begin{exrc}
  Examine \cref{tab:comp_statements}. Given the colloquial meaning of terms
  "and", "or", "not" and "equivalent" explain why the truth values in the table
  make sense.
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item "and"
    When we say that we want A \textit{and} B we want to have both at the same
    time. Hence if either A or B is false then we do not have both and hence
    the statement is false. This coincides with the truth table.
  \item "or"
    When we say "this or that" we mean "either this, or that, or both"
    therefore we only require at least one of A or B to be true for the
    statement "A or B" to be true.
  \item "not"
    Not is simply the negation. Hence if we have something, then the negation
    of that is not having something.
  \item "equivalent"
    Two statements are equivalent if one can swap one for the other without
    losing any meaning. In other words, we must have both A and B true or A and
    B false for the equivalence to be true.
\end{enumerate}
\end{sltn}

\begin{exmp}
  Given that $A$ and $B$ are statements we can look at the compound statements
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $B \land \neg B$:
      If we construct the truth table for this compound statement we see that
      the statement is always false. A compound statement that is always false
      is regardless of the truth value of the simpler statements involved is
      called a \textbf{contradiction}\index{contradiction}. 
    \item $(A \land \neg B) \eqvl \neg (A \impl B)$:
      This compound statement is true no matter what the truth value of the
      simpler statements involved is called a
      \textbf{tautology}\index{tautology}.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exmp}

\pagebreak
\begin{exrc}
  Verify that
  \begin{equation}
    \notag
    (A \impl (B \lor C)) \eqvl ((A \land \neg B) \impl C)
  \end{equation}
  is a tautology.
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
  \begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{cccccccc}
     \hline
     A& B & C & $B \lor C$ & $\neg B$ & $A \land \neg B$ & $A \impl (B \lor C)$ & $(A \land \neg B)\impl C$ \\
     \hline
     T& T & T & T & F & F & T & T\\ 
     T& T & F & T & F & F & T & T\\ 
     T& F & T & T & T & T & T & T\\ 
     T& F & F & F & T & T & F & F\\ 
     F& T & T & T & F & F & T & T\\ 
     F& T & F & T & F & F & T & T\\ 
     F& F & T & T & T & F & T & T\\ 
     F& F & F & F & T & F & T & T\\ 
     \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{table}
We here see that the statements $(A \impl (B \lor C))$ and $((A \land \neg B)
\impl C)$ have exactly the same truth values. We know that an equivalence only
hold if the two statements have the same truth values for all possible values
of the variables. Hence the equivalence is true no matter what, and we call it
a tautology.
\end{sltn}

\section{Learning from Truth Tables}
\label{sec:learning_from_truth_tables}

\begin{exrc}
  Consider the following statements.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $(A \impl (B \land C)) \impl (A \impl B)$.
    \item $(A \land (A \impl B)) \impl B$.
    \item $((A \impl B) \land (B \impl C)) \impl (A \impl C)$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Each of these statements are tautologies. First verify using truth tables
  that the statements are tautological. Then figure out what logical principles
  each statement embodies and what they tell us about proving theorems.\footnote{I am going to skip creating the truth tables as they take some time.}
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(A \impl (B \land C)) \impl (A \impl B)$.
      This statement tells us that if $A$ implies that $B$ and $C$ are true,
      then that implies that $A$ implies that $B$ is true. This means, in terms
      of proving theorems that we can show that the hypothesis implies a
      stronger conclusion ($B \land C$) than the one we want to show, and thus
      deduce that it must also hold for the weaker conclusion which we wanted
      to show ($B$).
    \item $(A \land (A \impl B)) \impl B$.
      If we know that $A \impl B$ is true, and that $A$ is true, then we can
      conclude with $B$ also being true.
    \item $((A \impl B) \land (B \impl C)) \impl (A \impl C)$.
      This statement tells us that implication has the transitive property. If
      both $A$ implies $B$ and $B$ implies $C$, then it must follow that $A$
      implies $C$. In terms of proving theorems, if we want to show that $A$
      implies $C$, then and we know that $B$ implies $C$ we can instead chose
      to prove that $A$ implies $B$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{sltn} 
\begin{defn}
  The implication $B \impl A$ is called the \textbf{converse}\index{converse} of $A \impl B$.
\end{defn}

\pagebreak
\begin{exrc}
  Construct a truth table to show that it is possible for $A \impl B$ to be
  true while its converse $B \impl A$ is false, and vice versa.
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{cccc}
    \hline
    A & B & A $\impl$ B & B $\impl$ A \\
    \hline
    T & T & T& T\\
    T & F & F& T\\
    F & T & T& F\\
    F & F & T& T\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
We here see that the implication and its converse are only equal in the two
cases where $A$ and $B$ have the same truth value. Hence, we cannot simply flip
the implication sign without changing the meaning of the statement.  Thus, we
have to treat a statement and its converse as two distinct mathematical claims.
\end{sltn}
\stepcounter{thm}
\begin{exrc}
  Find an example of a true statement whose converse is false and one whose converse is true. 
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item "If he lives in Oslo, then he lives in Norway" is true but has a false converse.
  \item "If $x^3 = 1$, then $x = 1$" is true, and has a true converse.
\end{enumerate}
\end{sltn}

Let us consider the truth table for $A \eqvl B$:
\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \caption{Equivalence}
  \label{tab:equivalence}
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
  \hline
   A&  B& A $\eqvl$ B\\
   \hline
   T&  T& T\\
   T&  F& F\\
   F&  T& F\\
   F&  F& T\\
   \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

We see that $A$ and $B$ must have the same truth value for the equivalence to
be true.  If $A \eqvl B$ is true, then we say that $A$ and $B$ are
\textbf{equivalent}\index{equivalent}. If we manage to prove $A$ we know that
$B$ is true as well and conversely.

Equivalence of statements are important because when proving a statement we can instead chose to prove an equivalent statement. Consider a statement on the form "If $A$, then $B$ or $C$", we can instead chose to prove either
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If $A$ and not $B$, then $C$.
  \item If $A$ and not $C$, then $B$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{exrc}
  Show by constructing a truth table that 
  \begin{equation}
    \notag
    (A \eqvl B) \eqvl ((A \impl B) \land (B \impl A))
  \end{equation}
  is a tautology.
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
    \hline
    A & B & A $\eqvl$ B & A ($\impl$ B) $\land$ (B $\impl$ A))\\
    \hline
    T& T& T& T\\
    T& F& F& F\\
    F& T& F& F\\
    F& F& T& T\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{sltn}

Hence, we can when proving equivalence of statements prove the one sided
implication and its converse instead. This is an important thing to remember.

\begin{exrc}
  Construct a truth table for the following four statements:\\
  \begin{tabular}{cccc}
    $\neg(A\land B)$& $\neg A\land \neg B$ & $\neg(A\lor B)$ & $\neg A \lor \neg B$
  \end{tabular} 
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
  \begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{cccccc}
    \hline
    A&  B&  $\neg(A\land B)$& $\neg A\land \neg B$ & $\neg(A\lor B)$ & $\neg A \lor \neg B$ \\
    \hline
   T&  T&  F&  F& F & F  \\
   T&  F&  T&  F& F & T \\
   F&  T&  T&  F& F & T \\
   F&  F&  T&  T& T & T \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{table}
\end{sltn}
  We can from this see that the negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of
  the negations and the negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the
  negations. These are what we call \textbf{De Morgan's laws}.\index{De
  Morgan's laws}

  \section{Negating Statements}
  \label{sec:negating_statements}
  
  Generally it is more useful to have a statement phrased positively. We can
  say "It is not true that $A$" but it is more useful to say what \textit{is} true, rather than what is not. For example, we typically rephrase the
  statement "$x$ is not even" as "$x$ is odd".

  \begin{exrc}
    Rephrase the statement "$x$ is not greater than 7" in positive terms.
  \end{exrc}
  
  \begin{sltn}
    If $x$ is not greater than 7 then it has to be less than or equal to 7.
    Hence the statement in positive terms is "$x$ is less than or equal to 7".
  \end{sltn}

  Sometimes it is impossible to rephrase a negative statement as a positive
  statement. In that case, the negative statement will have to do.

  \begin{exrc}
    Think colloquially about the meaning of AND and AND/OR. Explain why it
    makes sense for the negation of $A \lor B$ to be $\neg A \land \neg B$ and
    for the negation of $A \land B$ to be $\neg A \lor \neg B$.
  \end{exrc}
  \begin{sltn}
    What does it mean for $A \lor B$ to be false? Well, it is true if either
    $A$  $B$ or both are true, hence we need both $A$ and $B$ to be false for
    the negation to be true.  What does it mean for $A \land B$ to be false? It
    is true only if $A$ and $B$ are true, hence we need $A$ or $B$ or both to
    be false for the negation to be true.
  \end{sltn}

  \begin{exrc}
    Negate the following statements and if possible restate the statement in positive terms.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $x + y$ is even and $y + z$ is even.($x, y, z$ are fixed integers)
      \item $x > 0$ and $x$ is rational. ($x$ is a fixed real number)
      \item Either $l$ is parallel to $m$ or $l$ and $m$ are the same line.($l$ and $m$ are fixed lines in $\mathbb{R^2}$)
      \item The roots of this polynomial are either all real or all complex. 
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{exrc}
  
  \begin{sltn}
    Since the variables are fixed we do not have to worry about the assumed
    universal quantification.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item This is a conjunction. By De Morgans laws the negation is "$x + y$
        is odd or $y + z$ is odd".
      \item This is also a conjunction. The negation is "$x \leq 0$ or $x$ is
        irrational."
      \item This is a disjunction.  "$l$ is not parallel to $m$ and $l$ and $m$
        are not the same line". This can also be rephrased in positive terms as
        "$l$ intersects $m$ and $l$ and $m$ are distinct lines."
      \item This is a conjunction, so the negation becomes "There exist a root
        of this polynomial that is not real nor complex. Remember we have the
        assumed universal quantifier, hence we get an "There exist" in the
        negation.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{sltn}

  \begin{exrc}
    Using similar reasoning, find the negation of the statement "There exists a fast snail."
  \end{exrc}
  \begin{sltn}
    What does it mean for this statement to be false? In that case we must have
    no fast snails. Hence we get the negation "All snails are slow".
  \end{sltn}
  
  \begin{exrc}
    Negate the following statements and rephrase them in positive terms.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item There exists a line in the plane passing through the points $(-1, 1), (2, -1)$, and $(3, 0)$.
      \item There exists an odd prime number.
      \item For all real numbers $x, x^3 = x$.
      \item Every positive integer is the sum of distinct powers of three.
      \item For all positive real numbers $x$ there exists a real number $y$
        such that $y^2 = x$
      \item There exists a positive real number $y$ such that for all real
        numbers $x, y^2 = x$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{exrc}
  \begin{sltn} We negate each statement:
    \begin{enumerate} 
      \item All lines in the plane does not pass through the points $(-1, 1), (2, -1)$, and $(3, 0)$.
      \item All prime numbers are even.
      \item There exists a real number $x$ such that $x^3 \neq x$.
      \item There exists a positive integer that is not the sum of distinct powers of three.
      \item There exists a real number $x$ such that for all real numbers $y$, $y^2 \neq x$.
      \item For all positive real numbers $y$ there exists a real number $x$
        such that $y^2 \neq x$.
    \end{enumerate} 
  \end{sltn}

  \stepcounter{thm}
  We now look at a more complex example. Consider the statement "All Martians
  are short and bald, or my name isn't Darth Vader".  We can negate this by
  considering the various sub-statements.  The negation becomes "Either some
  Martian is tall or some Martian has hair, and my name is Darth Vader."

  We can now try our hands at the following problem
  \begin{prbl}
    Try to negate
    \begin{quote}
      \textit{You can fool some of the people all of the time, and some of the
      people none of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the
    time.}
    \end{quote}
  \end{prbl}

  \begin{sltn}
    We need to decompose this statement into the various sub-statements.  Let
    $A(x)$ = You can fool $x$ all of the time" and $B(x)$ = "You can fool $x$
    none of the time". Our statement then become, having $x$ refer to a person.
    There exists an $x$ such that $A(x)$ and there exist an $x$ such that
    $B(x)$, but not all $x$ can be fooled all of the time.\footnote{This is not
    finished, having problems creating the sub-statements I need in order to
  show this. I'll revisit this later.}
  \end{sltn}
 
  \pagebreak
  \begin{exrc}
    Show by constructing a truth table the equivalence of the two statements:
    \begin{quote}
      $\neg (A \impl B)$ and $A \land \neg B$.
    \end{quote}
  \end{exrc}
  \begin{sltn}
    \begin{table}[h!]
      \centering
      \caption{Negating an implication}
      \begin{tabular}{cccc}
        \hline
        A & B & $ \neg(A \impl B)$ & $A \land \neg B$\\
        \hline
        T& T& F& F\\
        T& F& T& T\\
        F& T& F& F\\
        F& F& F& F\\
        \hline
      \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
    This makes sense, since what does it mean for an implication to be false?
    Namely to have a value that makes the hypothesis true but the conclusion
    false.
  \end{sltn}
  \begin{exrc}
    Negate the statement "If $x^2 > 14$, then $x < 10$."
  \end{exrc}
  \begin{sltn}
    This is an implication, so we use what we just learned from the previous
    exercise. We need the hypothesis to be true and the conclusion to be false.
    Hence the negation becomes "$x ^2 > 14$ and $x > 10$". Actually, we have to
    also negate the assumed universal quantification in the implication. So the
    statement \textit{really} becomes "There exists an $x$ such that $x ^ 2 >
    14$ and $x > 10$.
  \end{sltn}

  \begin{exrc}
    Negate the following statements and rephrase them in positive terms.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item If $x$ is an odd integer, then $x^2$ is an even integer.
      \item If $x + y$ is odd and $y + z$ is odd, then $x + z$ is odd.
      \item If $f$ is a continuous function, then $f$ is a differentiable
        function.
      \item If $f$ is a polynomial, then $f$ has at least one real root.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{exrc}
  \begin{sltn}
    Remembering the assumed universal quantification we negate each
    statement.\footnote{Being fairly verbose here, just to emphasize the
    quantifiers.}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item There exists $x$ such that $x$ is an odd integer and $x^2$ is an
        odd integer.
      \item There exists an $x$ and there exists a $y$ and there exists a $z$
        such that $x + y$ is even or $y + z$ is even and $x + z$ is even.
      \item There exists an $f$ such that $f$ is a continuous function and $f$
        is not differentiable.
      \item There exists an $f$ such that $f$ is a polynomial and $f$ has no
        real roots.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{sltn}

  \begin{exrc}
    Let $f$ be the function $ f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Negate
    the following statement:
    \begin{quote}
      \textit{For all positive real numbers $r$, there exists a positive real
      number $s$ such that if the distance from $y$ to $3$ is less than $s$,
    then the distance from $f(y)$ to $7$ is less than $r$.}
    \end{quote}
  \end{exrc}
  \begin{sltn}
  I am going to rewrite this in mathematical notation, just to make the negation easier.
  We have:
  \begin{equation}
    \notag
    \forall r > 0, \exists s > 0 \text{ s.t } |y - 3| < s \impl |f(y) - 7| < r.
  \end{equation}
  We here see that we have quantified over all variables except $y$, hence we
  have to assume universal quantification over $y$. This gives us
  \begin{equation}
    \notag
    \forall r > 0, \exists s > 0 \text{ s.t }\forall y,  |y - 3| < s \impl |f(y) - 7| < r.
  \end{equation}

  We can now consider the sub-statements involved. 
  The statement is on the form $\forall r \exists s \text{ s.t } (A(s, y) \impl B(y, r))$,
  which in turn can be written as $\forall r \exists s$ s.t $P(s, r, y)$.
  We start negating:
  \begin{enumerate}[i.]
    \item $\exists r \forall s \exists y (\neg P(s, r, y))$.
    \item $\exists r \forall s \exists y (A(s, y) \land \neg B(r, r))$.
    \item $\exists r \forall s \exists y (|y - 3| < s \land |f(y) - 7| \geq r)$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Thus the negated statement is
  \begin{quote}
    \textit{There exists a positive real number $r$ such that for all positive
    real numbers $s$ there exists a $y$ such that the distance from $y$ to $3$
  is less than $s$ but the distance from $f(y)$ to 7 is greater than or equal
to $r$.}
  \end{quote}
  \end{sltn}

\section{Existence Theorems}
\label{sec:existence_theorems}

A theorem that asserts the existence of something is called an \textbf{existence theorem}\index{existence theorem}. We prove existence theorems in two steps.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Produce a "candidate". 
  \item We show that our candidate satisfies the theorem.
\end{enumerate}

Remember that when proving existence theorems, one does not actually need to
tell where the candidate came from. As long as it is given explicitly and is
shown to satisfies the requirements.

\section{Uniqueness Theorems}
\label{sec:uniqueness_theorems}

A theorem that guarantees the uniqueness of a mathematical object is called a
\textbf{uniqueness theorem}\index{uniqueness theorem}.
\begin{exmp}
  Assume that $x^3 + 37$ has a real root. Prove that it is has only one.
  \begin{proof}
    Assume that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are real numbers and that $x_1^3 + 37 = 0$ and
    $x_2^3 + 37 = 0$. Then $x_1 ^3 = x_2^3$. Since cube roots of real numbers
    are unique, $x_1 = x_2$.
  \end{proof}
\end{exmp}

\section{Examples and Counterexamples}
\label{sec:examples_and_counterexamples}

In order to prove that an implication is false, we need to provide a counterexample.
When we provide a counterexample, we are just showing that such a value exists. 

\begin{exrc}
  Give counterexamples to the following proposed (but false) statements.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If a real number is greater than 5, it is less than 10.
    \item If $x$ is a real number, $x^3 = x$.
    \item All prime numbers are odd numbers. \textit{What is the hypothesis
      here? What is the conclusion?}
    \item If $x+y$ is odd and $y+z$ is odd, then $x + z$ is odd.
    \item Given three distinct points in space, there is one and only one plane
      passing through all three points.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $x$ be the real number $11$. Then $x > 5$ but $x \not< 10$.
    \item Let $x$ be the real number $2$. Then $x^3 = 8 \neq x$.
    \item The number $2$ is by definition a prime number, but it can be written
      on the form $2n$ where $n = 1$. Hence $2$ is an even prime number.  The
      hypothesis here is $x$ is a prime number, and the conclusion is $x$ is
      odd.
    \item Let $x = 1$, $y = 2$, and $z = 1$. Then $x + y$ is odd, $y + z$ is
      odd, but $x + z$ is even.
    \item If we chose three points in $ \mathbb{R}$ along the $x$-axis, say
      $(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0)$ and $(2, 0, 0)$ then we have an infinite number of
      planes passing through these three points.
  \end{enumerate}  
\end{sltn}

\begin{exrc}
  Think about the implications given in the thought experiment. When you
  decided that one of them was false, did you justify your conclusion by means
  of a counter example? 
\end{exrc}

\begin{sltn}
  In the cases where I immediately saw an appropriate counter-example, I
  described it.  I could probably rewrite the ones I did not find a proof for
  using the language we now have learned. 
\end{sltn}

The process in which we draw conclusions about the general based on the
particular is called \textbf{inductive reasoning}\index{inductive reasoning}.
This is contrasted with \textbf{deductive reasoning}\index{deductive
reasoning}, which is the process of using the rules of logic to deduce logical
consequences.  In other words, inductive reasoning is how we make conjectures
in mathematics, where as deductive reasoning is how we prove these conjectures.

The moral of the story is that providing a counterexample is \textbf{conclusive
proof}\index{conclusive proof} that an implication is false. Just checking a
large number of examples, without being able to check all of them does not
prove an implication in general.

\section{Direct Proof}
\label{sec:direct_proof}

Remember that the statement "If $A$, then $B$" is true for all values of the
variables that make $A$ true make $B$ true also. Thus, one way of verifying
that the implication holds is the check all possible cases where the hypothesis
holds and see if the conclusion is true.

When an implication is proved by assuming that the hypothesis is true and then
showing that the conclusion is also true, the proof is called a \textbf{direct
proof}\index{direct proof}.

An example of a direct proof is the proof for the fact that if $x$ is an even
integer, then $x^2$ is an even integer.

\begin{exrc}
  If you haven't done so already, use the method of direct proof to prove that
  if $x + y$ is an even integer and $y + z$ is an even integer, then $x + z$
  is an even integer.
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
  We first assume that the hypothesis is true, and then we see if we can prove
  that the conclusion must be true as well. Assume that $x + y$ and $y + z$ are
  even numbers.  We then know that $x + y = 2n$ and $y + z = 2m$ for some
  appropriate integers $n$ and $m$.  Solving these two equations for $x$ and
  $z$ we get that $x = 2n - y$ and $z = 2m - y$. Hence 
  \begin{equation}
    \notag
    x + z = 2n - y + 2m - y = 2(n + m - y),
  \end{equation}
  where $n + m - y$ is an integer. Thus, $x + z$ is an even number. 
\end{sltn}

In addition to direct proof, we have two other common proof techniques, namely
proof by contrapositive and proof by contradiction.

\pagebreak
\section{Proof by Contrapositive}
\label{sec:proof_by_contrapositive}
\begin{exrc}
  Let $A$ and $B$ be predicates. Construct a truth table to show that the
  statements $A \impl B$ and $\neg B \impl \neg A$ are equivalent.
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
  We construct the truth table:
  \begin{table}[h!]
    \begin{tabular}{cccc}
      \hline
      $A$ & $B$ & $A \impl B$ & $\neg A \impl \neg B$\\
      \hline
      T& T& T& T\\
      T& F& F& F\\
      F& T& T& T\\
      F& F& T& T\\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{table}
\end{sltn}

These two statements are clearly equivalent, hence we can view the statement
"If not B, then not A" as a rephrasing of "If A, then B".
\begin{defn}
  The statement $\neg B \impl \neg A$ is called the
  \textbf{contrapositive}\index{contrapositive} of the statement $A \impl B$.
\end{defn}

\begin{exrc}
  Find the contrapositives of the following statements, and rewrite in positive terms when possible.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $x < 0$ then $x^2 > 0$.
    \item If $x \neq 0$ then there exists $y$ for which $xy = 1$.
    \item If $x$ is an even integer, then $x^2$ is an even integer.
    \item If $x + y$ is odd and $y + z$ is odd, then $x + z$ is odd.
    \item If $f$ is a polynomial of odd degree, then $f$ has at least one real root.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
    We find the contrapositives.
   \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $x^2 \leq 0$ then $x > 0$.
    \item This is on the form "If $\forall y, xy \neq 1$, then $x = 0$. Or in
      words: "If for all $y$, $xy \neq 1$ then $x = 0$.\footnote{This statement
      essentially asserts the existence of the reciprocal of all non-zero real
    numbers.}
   \item If $x^2$ is an odd integer, then $x$ is an odd integer.
   \item If $x + z$ is even, then $x + y$ is even or $y + z$ is even.
   \item If $f$ has no real root, then $f$ is a polynomial of even degree.
   \end{enumerate} 
\end{sltn}

\begin{exrc}
  Use your intuition for implication to explain why "If A, then B" and its
  contrapositive is saying the same thing.
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
  If an implication is true, then we know that whenever $A$ is true, $B$ must
  also be true.  Hence, if $B$ is not true, we cannot have that $A$ is true, when
  the implication is true. This means that the negation of $B$ must imply the
  negation of $A$ whenever the implication "If A, then B" is true.
\end{sltn}

A proof in which the contrapositive is proved instead of "If A, then B" is
called a \textbf{proof by contraposition}\index{proof by contrapositive} or a
\textbf{proof by contrapositive}. One simply finds out what the contrapositive
of the statement is and then proceeds to prove the contrapositive using a
direct proof. This works because the contrapositive is also an implication.

\section{Proof by Contradiction}
\label{sec:proof_by_contradiction}

\begin{exrc}
  Let $A, B, Q$ and $P$ be statements. Construct a truth table to show that the
  following statements are equivalent:
  \begin{equation}
    \notag
    Q \text{ and } \neg Q \impl (P \land \neg P), 
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    \notag
    A \impl B \text{ and } (A \land \neg B) \impl (P \land \neg P).
  \end{equation}
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
  We construct a truth table (I chose to omit the values for $A$ and $B$
  because the second line of equivalent statements follow from the first.)
  \begin{center} 
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    \hline
    $Q$& $P$& $\neg Q \impl (P \land \neg P)$\\
    \hline
    T&  T& T\\
    T&  F& T\\
    F&  T& F\\
    F&  F& F\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
If we now let $Q = A \impl B$, then we see that the negation of $Q$ implies a
contradiction.
\end{sltn}
Also note that the statement $P$ need not have anything to do with the
statements $A, B$ or $Q$.

\begin{exrc}
  Suppose you have statements $X$ and $Y$ in which
  \begin{equation}
    \notag
    X = A \impl B, \text{ so that } \neg X = A \land \neg B, \text{ and}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    \notag
    Y = P \land \neg P.
  \end{equation}
  If you know that $\neg X \impl Y$ is true, and $Y$ is false. What can you say
  about the truth value of $X$?
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
  Given that the conclusion $Y$ of a true implication is false, we know that
  the hypothesis $\neg X$ must be false for the implication to be true. It then
  follows that $X$ must be true.  Thus $A \impl B$ is true.
\end{sltn}

There is a proof technique called \textbf{proof by contradiction}\index{proof
by contradiction}, in which we first assume the statement we want to prove ($A
\impl B$) to be false, and then show that this implies something we know to be
false ($P \land \neg P$).

\stepcounter{thm}
\begin{exrc}
  Use proof by contradiction to prove that "If $x$ is an integer, then $x$
  cannot be both even and odd".
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
  We first observe that this is an implication on the form "If $A$, then $B$".
  We therefore assume the negation of this, namely $A \land \neg B$, and show
  that this leads to a contradiction, namely $P \land \neg P$.

  Assume that $x$ is an integer and $x$ is both even and odd. Since $x$ is even we can write
  \begin{equation}
    x = 2n
  \end{equation}
  for some integer $n$, and since $x$ is odd we can write
  \begin{equation}
    x = 2m + 1
  \end{equation}
  for some integer $m$. If we add the two equations (1.1) and (1.2) then we get
  \begin{equation}
    \notag
    2x = 2n + 2m + 1 = 2(n + m) + 1.
  \end{equation}
  Dividing by two yields
  \begin{equation}
    \notag
    x = (n + m) + \frac{1}{2}.
  \end{equation}
  Here, $n + m$ is known to be an integer, hence $x$ cannot be an integer
  because of the fraction $\frac{1}{2}$. This gives us the contradiction that
  we wanted, since we initially assumed $x$ to be an integer. Thus our
  contradicting statement is $P = $ "$x$ is an integer", and we have shown that
  both $P$ and $\neg P$ hold. Therefore our assumption is wrong and $x$ cannot
  be both even and odd.
\end{sltn}

\section*{Problems}
\label{sec:problems_1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Problems}

In this and the following problem sections, I will not recite the whole problem
text. Instead I will just answer the problem, in an effort to avoid too much
text.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Assuming variable $z$ to refer to (a) books, (b) automobiles, and (c) pencils.
    \begin{enumerate}[a)]
      \item The statement "For all $z$, $z$ has pages" is a true statement.
        "For all $z$, $z$ is red" is false, but "There exists $z$, such that
        $z$ is red" is true.
      \item "For all $z$, $z$ has an engine" is true. "For all $z$, $z$ has
        three wheels" is false, but "There exist $z$ such that $z$ has three
        wheels" is true.
      \item "For all $z$, $z$ can break" is true. "For all $z$, $z$ is blue" is
        false, but "There exists $z$ such that $z$ is blue" is true.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item We want to find a predicate $T(x)$ such that $\forall x, T(x)$ is true,
    but $\exists x, T(x)$ is false. But if we first consider what it means for
    $\exists x, T(x)$ to be false it must be that the statement $\forall x,
    \neg T(x)$ is true, which contradicts the fact that we want $\forall x, T(x)$ to be
    true. Hence the two statements cannot both be true at the same time.

  \item 
    \begin{enumerate}[a)]
      \item "If Dogs eat Meat, then Rome is in Italy" is a true statement.
      \item "If Dogs eat Meat, then Chocolate prevents cavities" is a false
        statements, since true implies false is false.
      \item "If Chocolate prevents cavities, then The moon is made of green
        cheese" is true, since false implies anything.
      \item "If the moon is made of green cheese, then Rome is in Italy" is
        also true. 
      \item "If Rome is in Italy, then the moon is made of green cheese" is
        false.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item 
    The assertions are as follows A = "All cats have four legs.", B = "I have
    four legs", C = "I am a cat." A is a predicate not a statement, but as soon
    as we put it in an implication we assume universal quantification.
    \begin{enumerate}[a)]
      \item Truth table for "If A and B, then C"
        \begin{table}[h!]
          \centering
        \begin{tabular}{cccc}
          \hline
          A&  B&  C& (A $\land$ B)$\impl$ C\\
          \hline
         T&  T&  T& T\\
         T&  T&  F& F\\
         T&  F&  T& T\\
         T&  F&  F& T\\
         F&  T&  T& T\\
         F&  T&  F& T\\
         F&  F&  T& T\\
         F&  F&  F& T\\
          \hline
        \end{tabular}
      \end{table}

      \item Cross out the lines of the truth table that don't apply in
        \textit{this particular instance}.
        \begin{table}[h!]
          \centering
        \begin{tabular}{cccc}
          \hline
          A&  B&  C& (A $\land$ B)$\impl$ C\\
          \hline
          T&  T&  T& T \ding{55}\\
          T&  T&  F& F \ding{51}\\
          T&  F&  T& T \ding{55}\\
          T&  F&  F& T \ding{55}\\
          F&  T&  T& T \ding{55}\\
          F&  T&  F& T \ding{55}\\
          F&  F&  T& T \ding{55}\\
          F&  F&  F& T \ding{55}\\
          \hline
        \end{tabular}
      \end{table}
      First of all he only considers the cases where all cats do have four legs
      so we cross out the lines with A false. We then cross out all the lines
      where "I have four legs" is false.  We finally cross out all the lines
      where "I am a cat" is true, because the actual truth value is false.  We
      are then left with the second line which tells us that the dog made the
      wrong conclusion. However, the converse of this particular line is true.
      So maybe the dog confused the statement for its converse?
    \end{enumerate}
  \item We refer to the equivalence discussed in example 1.7.6.
    \begin{enumerate}[a)]
      \item Why does it make sense to say that \textit{If A is true then either
        B is true or C is true} is the same as \textit{If A is true and B is
        false, then C is true}?
      
        If we first assume that the first statement is true. What does that
        mean? Well, either A is true or A is false. Looking at the case where A
        is true tells us that either B or C is true. Now, if we look at the
        second statement, if A is true, and B is false. Then for the first
        statement to still hold C must be true.

        This is not very rigorous, but constructing a truth table will show
        that it holds.
      
      \item We consider the statement "Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers".
        We want to find two equivalent rephrasing of this statement. We first observe
        that it is on the form
        \begin{quote}
          For all integers $x$, if $x$ is even and $x > 2$, then $x$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers.
        \end{quote}
        We can now consider for instance the contrapositive of this statement:
        \begin{quote}
          For all integers $x$, if $x$ cannot be written as the sum of two
          prime numbers, then $x$ is odd or $x \leq 2$.\footnote{I do
          \textbf{not}negate the quantifier here because it is not part of the
        conclusion nor the hypothesis hence does not get negated.}
        \end{quote}

        We can also rephrase the statement in terms of a contradiction. We assume the negation of the implication.
        \begin{quote}
          "If $x$ is even and $x > 2$, and $x$ cannot be written as the sum of
          two prime numbers, then $P \land \neg P$."
        \end{quote} 
        where $P$ is some arbitrary statement.
    \end{enumerate}  

    I did not consider these restatements when doing the thought-experiment. It
    does give a new perspective on the problem.

    \item We now construct a truth table to show that $A \impl (B \lor C)$ and
      $((A \impl B) \lor (A \impl C))$ are not equivalent statements.
      
      \begin{table}[h!]
        \centering
        \label{tab:label}
        \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
          \hline
         A&  B&  C&  $A \impl (B \lor C)$& $((A \impl B) \lor (A \impl C))$\\
          \hline
         T&  T&  T&  T& T\\
         T&  T&  F&  T& T\\
         T&  F&  T&  T& T\\
         T&  F&  F&  F& F\\
         F&  T&  T&  T& T\\
         F&  T&  F&  T& T\\
         F&  F&  T&  T& T\\
         F&  F&  F&  T& T\\
          \hline
        \end{tabular}
      \end{table}
      For some reason I get that the statements are equivalent. I'll take a
      closer look at this later. Disregard this result for now.
  
    \item "Marlene has brown hair". Explain why "Marlene has blond hair" is
      \textbf{not} the negation of this statement.
      We have to consider what it means for this statement to be false. In this
      case it is "Marlene does not have brown hair." This means that Marlene
      can have any hair color other than brown and the statement is still false.
      It does not have to be blond. 

    \item Prove that there exists a unique line passing through two distinct
      points $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ in $ \mathbb{R^2}$.
       
      We first need to prove the existence of such a \textit{straight}
      line\footnote{ \textit{straight} is typically omitted when no ambiguity
      arises}, and then we prove that the line is unique. A line is a set of
      points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the relation $y = mx + s$ for some real
      number $a$ and $b$.

      Using the slope-intersect formula we get that the line given by the
      equation
      \begin{equation}
        \notag
        y = \frac{d - b}{c - a}(x - a) + b
      \end{equation}
      satisfies the two points. Plugging in $a$ and $c$ for $x$ yields $b$ and
      $d$ respectively. We know need to show that this line is unique.
    
      We assume that there are two distinct lines $l$ and $m$ that both pass through the given points where $l$ and $m$ are given by
      \begin{equation}
        \notag
        y = nx + r
      \end{equation}
      \begin{equation}
        \notag
        y = mx + s.
      \end{equation}
      We know that these satisfy the points $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$, hence
      \begin{equation}
        \notag
        b = na + r = ma + s 
      \end{equation}
      \begin{equation}
        \notag
        d = nc + r = mc + s.
      \end{equation}
      By rearranging these equations we get that
      \begin{equation}
        \notag
        (n - m)a = r - s, 
      \end{equation}
      \begin{equation}
        \notag
        (n - m)c = r - s
      \end{equation}
      however, since we assumed that the points $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ were
      different, this cannot hold at the same time unless $n = m$ and $r = s$.
      We have therefore shown that the line passing through two distinct points
      is unique.\footnote{How does work if the $x$-coordinates of the two
      points are the same, but the $y$-coordinates differ? Does the linear
    function argument work then?}

  \item To show that an item is not \textit{unique} all we have to do is
    provide two examples of objects that both satisfy the criteria, but are
    different.
 
  \item 
    We want to prove that if $x$ is an odd integer, then $x^2$ is an odd integer.
    \begin{enumerate}[a)]
      \item "An integer is \textit{odd} if it can be written on the form $2n +
        1$" is a definition of an odd integer written in positive terms. It
        will be easier to work with, than the definition that relies on the
        definition of an even integer.

      \item We use a direct proof. Assume that the hypothesis is true, that $x$
        is an odd integer. Then there exists an integer $n$ such that $x = 2n +
        1$.  We now have $x^2 = (2n + 1)^2 = 4n + 2n + 1 = 2(2n + 1) + 1$. By
        definition of an odd number $m = (2n + 1)$ is an integer that satisfies
        the condition, hence $x^2 = 2m + 1$ is an odd number.
    \end{enumerate}
  
\end{enumerate}
\chapter{Sets}
\label{cha:sets}

\section{Sets and Set Notation}
\label{sec:sets_and_set_notation}

\textbf{Set}\index{set}, \textbf{element}\index{element} and $\in$\index{$\in$}
are the undefined terms of set theory.  A set is a collection of "things". An
element is one of the things that lie in the set.  We write $x \in A$ is $x$ is
an element of the set $A$. We write $x \notin A$ if $x$ is not in the set.

To describe a set we say what elements are in the set,
\begin{equation}
  \notag
  A  = \left\{ a, b, c, d \right\}, 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \notag
  S = \left\{ \left\{ 1, 2 \right\}, \left\{ 1, 3, 5 \right\}, \left\{ 1, 6, 8
  \right\} \right\}   
\end{equation}
We can also describe a set by the properties its element has
\begin{equation}
  \notag
  E = \left\{ e \in \mathbb{N} \mid e \text{ is the number of edges on one of
  the five platnoic solids} \right\}.
\end{equation}
These sets are on the form $S = \left\{ x \in X \mid P(x) \right\}$ where
$P(x)$ is a predicate in the free variable $x$ and $X$ is the set that gives
the range of acceptable values for $x$.

\stepcounter{thm}

\begin{exmp}
  Since we often talk about \textit{intervals} in $\mathbb{R}$, we use the \textbf{interval notation}\index{interval notation}. Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are fixed real numbers. Then
  \begin{align*}
    \left[ a, b \right] &= \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid a \leq x \leq b \right\} \\
    \left[ a, b \right) &= \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid a \leq x < b \right\} \\
    \left( a, b \right] &= \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid a < x \leq b \right\} \\
    \left( a, b \right) &= \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid a < x < b \right\} \\
  \end{align*}
  $ \left[ a, b \right]$ is called the \textbf{closed interval}\index{closed
  interval} from $a$ to $b$, $\left( a, b \right)$ is called the \textbf{open
  interval}\index{open interval} from $a$ to $b$, and $\left[ a, b \right)$ and
  $\left( a, b\right]$ are referred to as \textbf{half-open intervals}\index{half-open intervals}.
\end{exmp}

If there are no $x \in X$ that make $P(x)$ true then the set contains no element.
\begin{defn}
  The set with no elements is called the \textbf{empty set}\index{empty set};
  it is denoted by $\emptyset$\index{$\emptyset$}.
\end{defn}

\section{Subsets}
\label{sec:subsets}

We now start studying some relations between different sets.
\begin{defn}
  If $A$ and $S$ are sets, we say that $S$ is a \textbf{subset}\index{subset}
  of $A$ if every element of $S$ is also in $A$.(This can be written as "If $x
  \in S$, then $x \in A$".) We denote this by $S \subseteq
  A$\index{$\subseteq$}.
\end{defn}

We now show that every non-empty set has at least two subsets.
\begin{thm}
For all sets $X$, $\emptyset \subseteq X$ and $X \subseteq X$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  We start by showing that $\emptyset \subseteq X$. By the definition of
  subset, we must have that 
  \begin{equation}
    \notag
    x \in \emptyset \impl x \in X.
  \end{equation}
  Since there are no values for $x$ that satisfy the hypothesis, we say that
  this is \textit{vacously true} i.e, the hypothesis is false for all possible
  values of $x$.

  We now show that 
  \begin{equation}
    x \in X \impl x \in X.
  \end{equation} 
  The conclusion follows immediately from the hypothesis. Hence the statement
  is true.  This means that any arbitrary non-empty set $X$ has at least two
  subsets.
\end{proof}

\begin{exrc}
  How many subsets does $\emptyset$ have?
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
  We use the definition of subsets again. We see that for a set to be a subset
  of $\emptyset$ the set can at most have as many elements as $\emptyset$.
  There is only one set that satisfies this property, and that is the empty set
  itself. Hence, $\emptyset \subseteq \emptyset$. 
\end{sltn}

Notice that "If $x \in S$, then $x \in X$" is a very common statement. It is
called an \textbf{element argument}\index{element argument}.

\begin{exrc}
  Prove that if $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq C$, then $A \subseteq C$.
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
  We use a direct proof and assume that the hypothesis is true.  Let $x \in A$,
  then by the hypothesis we must have $x \in B$, but since $x \in B$ we must
  also have $x \in C$. Hence $x \in A \impl x \in C$, and therefore we have $A
  \subseteq C$ by definition of subset.
\end{sltn}

\begin{defn}
  If $B$ is a subset of $X$ and $B \neq X$, then we say that $B$ is a
  \textbf{proper subset}\index{proper subset} of $X$.
\end{defn}

\begin{exrc}
  Give two proper subsets of the set $\left\{ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 \right\}$.
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
  We need to find two subsets that are not equal to the set itself.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $A = \left\{ 1, 5, 7, 9 \right\}$
    \item $B = \left\{ 3, 11 \right\}$
  \end{itemize}
  are two proper subsets of $\left\{ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 \right\}$.
\end{sltn}

We now introduce the notion of equality between sets.
\begin{defn}
  Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are sets. Then $A = B$\index{set equality}\index{$ =
  $ (sets)} if $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$.
\end{defn}

\section{Set Operations}
\label{sec:set_operations}

We now need to see how we can \textit{build} new sets from old ones.

\begin{defn}
  Let $U$ be a set. Let $S \subseteq U$. Define
  \begin{equation}
    \notag
    S_U^C = \left\{ x \in U \mid x \notin S \right\}.
  \end{equation}
  The set $S_U^C$ is called the \textbf{complement}\index{complement} of $S$ in
  $U$. We sometimes omit the subscript $U$ if there is no ambiguity.
\end{defn}

\begin{exrc}
Consider the intervals $U = \left[ -5, 5 \right]$ and $S = \left[ -5, 2 \right]$. Find $S_U^C$.
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
  We are here looking for the set $\left\{ x \in \left[ -5, 5 \right] \mid x
  \notin \left[ -5, 2 \right] \right\}$.  This must be the set (interval)
  \begin{equation}
    \notag
    S_U^C = \left( 2, 5 \right].
  \end{equation}
\end{sltn}

\begin{exrc}
As in the previous exercise. Let $S = \left[ -5, 2 \right]$. What is $S_\mathbb{R}^C$? 
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
  This must be the set
  \begin{equation}

\begin{defn}[Unions and intersections]
  Let $A$ and $B$ be sets.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $A \union B = \left\{x \mid  x \in A \lor x \in B \right\}$ is called the \textbf{union}\index{union}\index{$\union$} of the sets $A$ and $B$.
    \item $A \intrsct B = \left\{ x \mid x \in A \land x \in B \right\}$ is called the \textbf{intersection}\index{intersection}\index{$\intrsct$} of the sets $A$ and $B$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{exrc}
  Consider the following pairs of sets:
  \begin{equation}
    \notag
    A = \left\{ a, b, c, d, e, f, g \right\} \text{ and } B = \left\{ a, e, i, o, u \right\}.
  \end{equation}
  Find $A \intrsct B$ and $A \union B$.
\end{exrc}

\begin{sltn}
  We have
  \begin{equation}
    \notag
    A \intrsct B = \left\{ a, e \right\}, 
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    \notag
    A \union B = \left\{ a, b, c, d, e, f, g, e, i, o, u \right\}.
  \end{equation}
\end{sltn}

\begin{defn}
  If $A$ and $B$ are sets that do not intersect (that is, if $A \intrsct B =
  \emptyset$), we say that $A$ and $B$ are \textbf{disjoint}\index{disjoint}.
\end{defn}

\begin{exrc}
  Give an example of a pair of disjoint subsets of $ \mathbb{R} $.
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
  We want the intersection between these two sets to be empty.  If we let $A =
  \overline{ \mathbb{Q} }$ and $B = \mathbb{Q}$ be the irrational numbers and
  the rational numbers, respectively, then their intersection is empty.  That
  is
  \begin{equation}
    \notag
    A \intrsct B = \emptyset.
  \end{equation}
\end{sltn}

\begin{exrc}
  Let $A, B$ and $X$ be sets. Prove that $X \subseteq A \intrsct B$ if and only if $X
  \subseteq A$ and $X \subseteq B$. 
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
  We know that an $P \eqvl Q$ is the same as $P \impl Q \land Q \impl P$. Thus
  we only have to show two implications.
  \begin{enumerate}[i)]
    \item Right implication. Let $x \in X$. By assumption we must have $x \in A
      \land x \in B$. But this is just saying that $x \in A$ and $x \in B$.
      Hence, $x \in X \impl X \in A \land x \in B$, and therefore we have $X
      \subseteq A$ and $X \subseteq B$.
    \item Left implication. Let $x \in X$. By assumption we must have $x \in A$
      and $x \in B$.  But then, we must also have $x \in A \intrsct B$, and
      therefore we have $X \subseteq A\intrsct B$.
  \end{enumerate}

  Suppose you have three sets $A, B$ and $C$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Use your intuition to devise definitions for $A \union B \union C$ and $A \intrsct B \intrsct C$.
    \item Draw Venn diagrams to illustrate.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
  Intuitively, $A \union B \union C$ should be the set $\left\{ x \mid x \in A
  \lor x \in B \lor x \in C \right\}$ and $A \intrsct B \intrsct C$ should be
  the set $\left\{ x \mid x \in A \land x \in B \land x \in C
  \right\}$.\footnote{I have not payed attention to the associativity of these
  here, just remember they must be proved to be associative.} Using Venn
  diagrams this can be illustrated as

\begin{exmp}
  We can look at a set of intervals by indexing the set for easy reference.
  Suppose we want to look at the sets $\left[ 0, 1/n \right]$ for various
  values of $n$.  We can index these sets like
  \begin{equation}
    \notag
    I_1 = \left[ 0, 1 \right], I_2 = \left[ 0, 1/2 \right], I_3 = \left[ 0, 1/3 \right] \ldots
  \end{equation}

  In this case the sets are \textbf{indexed}\index{indexed} by the natural
  numbers, $\mathbb{N}$.
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
  If $\Lambda$ is some arbitrary set, and we have a collection of sets that is indexed
  by $\Lambda$ we can compactly write this collection of sets this way:
  \begin{equation}
    \notag
    \left\{ U_\alpha \right\}_{\alpha \in \Lambda}, 
  \end{equation}
  which we read as "the set of $U$-alpha's over alpha in lambda".
\end{exmp}

\begin{defn}[Unions and intersections, revisited]
  Suppose we have a collection of sets $\left\{ B_\alpha \right\}_{\alpha \in
  \Lambda}$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The union of all the sets is denoted by $\bigcup\limits_{\alpha \in \Lambda}
      B_\alpha$, which we read as "the union over alpha in lambda over the
      $B$-alpha's." An element $x$ is in $\bigcup\limits_{\alpha \in \Lambda}
      B_\alpha$ if $x \in B_\alpha$ for some $\alpha \in \Lambda$. That is,
      \begin{equation}
        \notag
        \bigcup_{\alpha \in \Lambda} B_\alpha = \left\{ x \mid x \in B_\alpha \text{ for some } \alpha \in \Lambda \right\}.
      \end{equation} 

    \item The intersection of all the sets is denoted by $\bigcap\limits_{\alpha \in \Lambda}
      B_\alpha$, which we read as "the intersection over alpha in lambda over the
      $B$-alpha's." An element $x$ is in $\bigcap\limits_{\alpha \in \Lambda}
      B_\alpha$ if $x \in B_\alpha$ for all $\alpha \in \Lambda$. That is,
      \begin{equation}
        \notag
        \bigcap_{\alpha \in \Lambda} B_\alpha = \left\{ x \mid x \in B_\alpha \text{ for all } \alpha \in \Lambda \right\}.
      \end{equation} 
    
  \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{exrc}
  Let $\Lambda = \left\{ 1, 2, 3 \right\}$. Do the definitions of union and
  intersection given in the previous definition correspond to the ones in the
  previous exercise?
\end{exrc}
\begin{sltn}
  Yes they do, for an element $x$ to be in $\bigcap\limits_{\alpha \in \Lambda}
  B_\alpha$ it needs to be in \textit{all} the sets. And for
  $\bigcup\limits_{\alpha \in \Lambda} B_\alpha$ it needs to be in \textit{at
  least one} of the sets.
\end{sltn}

    \item Let $\left\{ I_n \right\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ be the collections of
      intervals in Example 2.3.11.

        \item Find $\bigcup_{n\in \mathbb{N}} I_n$.
        \item Find $\bigcap_{n\in \mathbb{N}} I_n$.

      How would the answer be different if the intervals were open instead of
      closed?
    \item Now let $\left\{ C_t \right\}_{t \in \mathbb{R}}$ be the collections
      of circles as in Example 2.3.11.
      \begin{enumerate}[a)]
        \item Find $\bigcup_{t\in \mathbb{R}} C_t$.

        \item $\bigcap_{n\in \mathbb{N}} I_n = \left\{ 0 \right\}$.
      \end{enumerate}
      If we instead look at the open intervals, we would get the sets
      \begin{enumerate}[a)]
        \item $\bigcup_{n\in \mathbb{N}} I_n = \left(0, 1 \right)$
        \item $\bigcap_{n\in \mathbb{N}} I_n = \emptyset$.

      \begin{equation}
        \notag
        C_t = \left\{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid (x - t)^2 + y^2 = 1\right\}.
